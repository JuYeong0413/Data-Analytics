"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Love the Dot and its new look, but the sound is still disappointing","I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.And it's not bad!What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams ""I'm a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.(To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.At all.With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What's my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition softwarebecomes more advanced.This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.(Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.(This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music ornewscasts.As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.Hope this was helpful!",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Love my echo dot! So helpful and the GGMM D3battery base makes it portable!","<U+00A0>I love my echo dot. I have four of them and they really help make my life easier. They can control almost everything, lights, locks TV, music, thermostat. It hears you almost all of the time and I've run into very few issues with it overall. I really couldn't ask for a more helpful device. It's even more handy when I found that I could get a battery base for it. The GGMM D3 base that I found lets me carry the alexa dot around pretty much anywhere. I love that I can take it into the bathroom with me and listen to music while I shower or take it outside and listen to music. That's really the only thing I think it was missing.",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Overall improvement, but lost its flexibility","I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Actually impressed.","I was debating between this and the regular echo. I've had both and we both know what the echo does so all I'll talk about is the sound quality.I'm going to get to the chase. This is the BEST speaker I've ever heard for under $50. The functions of the echo along with the music playing functionality and the sound quality makes it a steal at this price point.The sound is great for its size. It can get pretty loud but the bass is definitely lacking. The bass isn't god awful but it just isn't there.Now I will say this... if your primary motivation for a speaker is to listen to music, go with the echo. If it is but your budget is under $50 then go with the dot. It won't blow anyone away during a get together in your living room but it'll get the job done. The dot will only flourish is an enclosed space. It needs walls nearby to bounce off to cover up the weakness of the bass.If I had to compare the sound to another speaker, I'd say the UE Wonderboom or the older Beats Pill, all of which suffer from weak bass. For the size, I was impressed by the sound but with the Echo at its refurbished price of $69 I'll have to aim towards that direction.I'd recommend this for someone who needs an echo for their kitchen, bedroom or bathroom. It's just not going to hold down a living room unfortunately but overall, I like the sound and if I need a second echo, I'll definitely get a dot.",1

"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","A defect product","Hey, In general I love my Echo, but I got a defect product with a noises while I playing music. After a long chat with Amazon on online support channel they came to conclusion that my Echo device have a problem, there is need to say that I used her only for 2 weeks and only on weekends.I truly love this device but it s*ck that its have this problem, and they couldn't help my case because I do not longer in the U.S, I only visit there every year+ ... even a refund they disagree to offer if they will not shut down the device remotely. My reply for this solution was ""I bought this device to use it, and I don't want to stay with nothing...""I wish there someone else who could help me in this case, I payed good money for this ($53.11) and I got a bad felling afterwards ...the agent in the support channel even asked me to send the device from the country I'm living right nowbut this will cost even more, and he knew that. Another funny solution he offered me is to send the device in one more year and replace it *if* I will visit again in that time frame in the US.",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Muffled","I bought this to replace my old Echo Dot gen 2. I am very disappointed. Alexa sounds distant and muffled. Music playback and the alarms sound normal. There is something wrong when she speaks and I have to turn the echo dot up. Only problem is, when the alarm goes off in the mornings it¡¯s super loud. Wish they would add new volume settings is this is going to be the norm going forward. Also, very disappointed in Amazon customer service. I was supposed to have a call back yesterday morning between 8:30am-9:3am CST and it never happened. I will be requesting a replacement device and I¡¯m leaving this bad review in part because of the failed customer service promise.",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","The CLOCK for the winnnnn.","<U+00A0>I¡¯ll start by saying that I have owned every version of this Echo dot so far. I also have google home but still prefer the Amazon ecosystem overall. This Echo dot with the clock display was a NO BRAINER for me, I¡¯ve been waiting on a clock feature for a couple years now. This newer version is 90% the same as the original Gen 3 echo dot so I won¡¯t rehash that review again. In short¡¦. This is the SAME as the original gen 3 but this version adds a clock and a few more tweaks related to the clock and display. Here are some highlights below in a nutshell:-Same as original Gen 3...but with a very useful clock!-Sound is powerful and can be heard across any room. Thanks to the EQ in the Alexa app you can tweak the sound even more.-The LED clock is genius! Shows the weather and has adaptive brightness settings.-In my opinion the clock is worth an extra $10 for the Echo dot-LED time/temperature visible from across the room, even in the daytime.Room For Improvement??-Sorry...I¡¯m still not feeling this power cord. A USB-C connector would have been perfect! I¡¯d even take a micro usb connector compared to the default cord.-Why is the power brick so thick?? My Phone charger has even more power than the Echo power brick at half the size *Head scratch*-The sound is definitely an improvement vs the 2nd Gen echo but it feels just a TAD lower compared to the newest google mini (maybe since the mini has front facing speakers)My Verdict? I give this Echo Dot with LED Clock TWO THUMBS UP! Works great for a bedside clock and I have one in the bathroom now as well for morning news and to tell the time.",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","POTENTIALLY THE MOST DANGEROUS DEVICE IN YOUR HOME!","Works to good, apparently while I was asleep I woke up for a few minutes but wasn't really coherent, idk what I said if anything to activate the Alexa controller device however, it recorded several minutes of me babbling on about dropping my medication box all over the floor. It was then sent out to my friends that had a Amazon device, there friends and family and god knows where else, apparently it had used my contacts to send that voice message to my friends, family and everyone in my contacts, it also somehow sent the voice message to my friends contacts and there contacts and so on n so on. I turned off my Amazon Dot that day after several of my friends called me to ask ""What's going on, at 7:00am or so I was woken up by a long babbling message from you, one friend said his sister got it to, idk his sister. Be careful ppl, I've since gone into my Amazon account/Devices/Recordings and found hundreds if not thousands of voice commands,messages etc etc, I deleted them all and deregistered my several devices that I no longer own, I didnt know they stay connected until you remove them and all the data retrieved by them. Very dangerous device if not properly and thoroughly setup completely, read all of the instructions, follow them and, goto a non Amazon site for tips, ideas and what and what ""*NOT TO DO*"", Sincerely, an embarrassed, frustrated and unhappy Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation (What not to do) previous user.",1
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Best thing ever.","This is how it all begins.The end of man.Alexa took over my house.It¡¯s started on Black Friday 2019.Amazon offered a deal that couldn¡¯t be beat. Once I had SkyNet I mean Alexa hooked up and running it began.I got lazy, really lazy and I loved it.I was hooked.I ordered six more echos.I ordered smart light bulbs and Smart light switches, smart thermostat and smart plugs and Ring cams.It won¡¯t end.Now Alexa is everywhere. Listening.Judging me. Watching.Probably waiting for the right time to strike a blow in America¡¯s heartland.It¡¯s a slow process. But Alexa is patient.I¡¯m so lazy now I don¡¯t get up to turn the light off or change my thermostat. I can even see who¡¯s at the door from my couch.I¡¯m gaining weight slowly.And in a few decades I¡¯ll die, probably of heart disease.The calories I burned moving around and now being stored.My LDL is out of whack.All because I bought an Alexa enabled device On Black Friday 2019.I can hear my arteries clogging as we speak.In the end I was weak.I let the machines win.",2

"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Best Echo dot ever!","<U+00A0>This is a very good smart speaker. It has way better sound than the previous version!",2
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Con limitaciones para uso en espanol","El echo dot tiene una construccion y desempeno sobresalientes:Pequeno, con buen sonido, el anillo de luz da retroalimentacion util y puede usarse un parlante alternativo por cable o bluetooth; el asistente (Alexa) en espanol es competente y no tan mecanico como el de GoogleHome. Si bien el uso en espanol es posible y util, tiene limitaciones asociadas con restricciones asociadas a la tienda en que se compra (la de EEUU, Mexico o Espana dan acceso a conjuntos diferentes de skills de Alexa; por ejemplo en la de EEUU no es posible habilitar algunos servicios de noticias que si estan disponibles en la de Espana) y a la pobre oferta de interfaces en espanol o para mercados fuera de EEUUde algunas aplicaciones¡¦ limitando su valor (por ejemplo, no he podido hacer la integracion con Harmony Hub, pues al usar el Echo dot fuera de EEUU no se habilita el uso del skill).",2
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Almost returned it!","<U+00A0>I almost returned this to seller as I wasn't able to get it to connect to my wifi. After getting an error message from the app to scan I of course called the help line. I hung up on two of the Indonesia people I talked to as the first wanted me to purchase security software for my router. BS.. The second time I told them I was going to through it away and they hu g up on me and the third time i asked for someone who could speak English. He said there all busy but he did attempt to help me which led me to going to alexa.amazon.com and syncing it up there. After a few minutes of going through the links I got it to scan. Keep in mind I did restart my router before this but not sure if that had anything to do with fixing it. Anyway go to the link above and sign in with your amazon account and try that before the Alexa App on your phone. YOU WILL HAVE TO CONNECT YOUR WIFI ON YOUR COMPUTER TO Amazon Alexa Wifi. This is not permanent it's just to get your Alexa to connect on it's own. Kinda dumb and confusing. Don't expect Alexa to play Amazon music as it wont connect if it's not a paid service from what I gather. I have a free Pandora account which one can connect from the app then Alexa will let one play music from there once you give it permission to access your account. Plan on at least an hour to get the gist on how all this is done and once you get it working you'll feel pretty good about it and you'll be saying oh that so cool! That's cool too and so on. I'm about 30 feet away from mine in a bedroom and Alexa in the kitchen and she can hear my commands. The sound is pretty decent for such a small size hockey puck. You can get some free stuff such as woof woof for your dog and have a few giggle. (through the app.)Please don't contact me on how to connect it.",2
"October 15, 2018","the United States","2","Not ready for prime time","This is the epitome of a good idea marred by poor execution. A lot of the stock skills (Disney Stories, for instance, which is a large part of why I bought the thing) are clunky or glitchy, and have tons of bugs. It doesn't handle errors gracefully- and leaves me in the position of trying to explain a software bug to a 4 year old who doesn't understand and just wants a Puppy Dog Pals story before bed.I can't switch profiles and use FreeTime with another profile. The end result is that every time my kids ask it to play music, it cuts off my Spotify, which is hindering my ability to listen at work. On top of that, if they don't specify the song, it has some pretty weird choices for kids' music- most notable recently is ""Emotion"" by the Bee Gees.It's as strict as a regular Alexa at interpreting commands- ""Read me Disney Stories"" gets you the Disney Stories skill, but ""Read me a Disney story"" gets you the Disney Wikipedia entry read to you- and this isn't really ideal for children.Perhaps worst of all, the parental controls over skills is pretty spotty. For instance, it lets my kids control our Nest thermostat even in FreeTime, which is unfortunate because I accidentally let them overhear me doing it recently and all it took was one time hearing the command for them to start messing with the temperature. It lets them control our Master Bedroom lights from their room. It also lets them randomly drop in on other Echoes- awkward when Mommy and Daddy are enjoying some ""alone time"" or when Great Grandma can't figure out why she can hear them coming from her device.And you don't even want to hear about the time the trigger word was randomly changed on its own. That took thirty agonizing minutes of crying toddler tantrum to figure out (and I suspect I got it faster than most- I do software troubleshooting for a living!)Honestly, the best I can say is that the year of FreeTime that comes with it is nice- but in the end I wish I had not bought it. Now getting rid of it would feel like a punishment to them, so the tranquility of my home for the foreseeable future is at the dubious mercy of underpaid and overworked Amazon developers...Alexa, play Despacito.",2
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Really? A proprietary AC wall plug?","What could Amazon be thinking by giving the new Dot a HUGE, proprietary (kiss your micro USB plugins goodbye), AC adapter plug? This thing takes up a full outlet plug [15W adapter] and doesn't even have USB ports on the side to be useful. I'm sure Amazon heard all about inferior micro usb plugs being used with Alexa, and thus they went and made something universally worthless to ""fix"" the problem, rather than telling people to just use the better equipment they ALREADY OWN! Frankly, I don't care if the new one is ""new and improved"" when such a glaring step-down was taken with the actual, physical unit. I equally despise HP's proprietary power plugs for printers and laptops; what a scam! I'm sure Amazon is going to be more than happy to sell these plugs en-masse when they fail and Echo's are turned into non-working pieces of tech trash until you buy a new, expensive plug, rather than just pulling another Micro USB from your drawer! They could have at least went with USB-C; good grief.I'm going to go read if Google was as equally stupid with their Mini this year, and if not....",2
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Wow! What an upgrade! (Update included about ¡°Clock¡±)","Update: also bought a Dot 3 with Clock. It¡¯s all the things the regular Dot 3 is, with a digital clock. I was hoping it would be nice for a bedside clock, but not so much. It has a very responsive auto dimming feature- that¡¯s the good. But the level to which it dims is STILL too bright for my bedside. I won¡¯t change the starts for my original review since Amazon thinks this is the same product. But I will say that as a bedside clock, the display only gets 2 STARS <U+2B50><U+FE0F> <U+2B50><U+FE0F>.There is an opportunity for salvation though.

There will be audiophiles who will put this down, and they should since this is not intended to be the worlds best speaker. But, if you deploy a house-full of these things, you will have a robust all-over speaker system that can do all sorts of things.Now I¡¯m forced to consider the fate of my Gen2 Dots.Side note: the amount of people complaining about this thing is astonishing. I believe most are the type who would complain if their ice water was cold. I have a rather large Echo ecosystem in my home. In the first 30 minutes of setup, I knew this was an upgrade from Dot2. It¡¯s a no brainer. Short of an actual defective product (it happens), I can¡¯t understand where the problem is. Setup was fine- came mostly configured right out of the box. Sound quality is excellent FOR A 1.6¡± SPEAKER. If you want home automation control, with compatible devices that do not require a hub, this will take you there. If you want stadium rocking sound, you¡¯re an idiot for thinking this was even close. If you want whole home audio at a reasonable adult level, 6 of these would be amazing. All of the connection issues are most likely shitty home networks, and dots on different bands in said shitty networks. Yes, some networks will ¡®talk¡¯ across 2.4 ang 5GHz bands - but not all. Depends solely on your equipment/router and settings there in. Some routers, like Spectrum¡¯s Ubee, will not maintain an address lease for long connected devices like these. So it would appear that these need to be frequently restarted to maintain functionality when in fact it is the fault of the router. A nice, cheap TP-Link router (available here, of course) can fix all of that.Disclaimer: I work in technology. I¡¯m a manager of network administration. I understand these limitations and my expectations are appropriately calibrated.Honesty, theses are basically fancy tuna cans. What did you think it was gonna sound like? Still the best sounding tuna can I own!",2

I haven't played around with everything this does, not really into all that game play/etc with alexa stuff. The music, shopping list/cart and phone messaging is all i care about really (am looking at them plugs to turn thing on & off with alexa too now) and there are some issues like everytime i say order/buy something, it gets added to cart and am told to go there instead of alexa ordering/checking out even though one click and all is turned on.. also we first set this up on my ipad and needed a phone number to set up a part in app, being new to this, we didn't realize it would become that ipad's phone number for messages/etc.. and installing app on phone afterwards resulted in us not being able to set up communication on it because cell phone number was already being used by ipad -anyhow sure others already described everything about this echo 3. i like it, music sounds great to me on it (although not older music) and i can unplug it anytime i want and it easily reconnects by itself within a minute when i plug it back in. i don't bother with that part anymore since i keep it in kitchen corner but, it is nice to know i can unplug it and not have to redo setup when i decide to get more echo's for other areas of our house.i will say i was suprise at how far/well this echo 3 can hear us, i told alexa to shut off when i was in opposite side of house in living room to see if alexa/echo could hear us there and yup she heard me.. will admit at first that bothered me but, now not so much.",2

I mean, I've been using my Gen 1 Echo Dot in our kitchen for a timer and all other fun Alexa-enabled skills, so adding this to my bedroom was a natural. Setting the old alarm clock was a chore, but now it's as easy as ""Alexa, wake me up at 5:05 a.m. tomorrow."" And, it's great to have her read me the news while I get dressed. The alarm possibilities are endless, but I chose a classic one. You can dim or brighten the clock display 1-10, or make it respond to the light conditions. I set up my bedside lamps with a smart plug and the Alexa app recognized them quickly. Suffice to say, my bedroom experience has been modernized, and I love it!",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Terrible Bedside Alarm Clock","The problems with using this device (Echo Dot with Clock) as a bedside alarm clock are:1. If the power (or WiFi / internet access) goes out, the alarm does not go off.The device does not have an integrated battery backup (like cheap dedicated alarm clocks... or a phone...).You could buy a small UPS power strip to overcome this, though.2. Even at the lowest 1% adaptive brightness setting, the clock way too bright... about twice as bright as our old-school Sony alarm clock3. When the alarm goes off, the top ring lights up at full BLINDING brightness (not dim-able or disable-able).And, if you have the escalating sound option turned on, the lights still light up right away, about 10 seconds before any audible-level sound can be heard, defeating the purpose of the escalating sound option.4. Turning off the alarm requires speech.You can tap the top of the device to ""snooze"", but there is no physical way to turn off the alarm without speaking to it.Some instructions online say that you can press the ""wake button"", but pressing the ""wake button"" and not also saying ""stop alarm"" only snoozes the alarm.",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Multi-echo household.. not impressed with this model.","We are a multi-echo household. We've bought echo devices for 4 other family/households. But I am really unimpressed with this one.I tried setting this one up in the kitchen. It was replacing a 2nd gen, which worked flawlessly for most of the year. But I wanted to put the 2nd gen in the basement, and replace it with this 3rd gen... The 3rd gen is slow to respond, to the point one thinks it didn't hear you and is turning off... only to then respond. It constantly drops connection and has a hard time reconnecting. -- the 2nd gen in the basement works perfectly. No dropped connections, no delays in response..I also put a 3rd gen in my bedroom, which has no issues, no delays, no dropped connection. So I assumed it was a bad dot and requested a replacement.Replacement got here today (I wasn't made aware it would be a refurbished one). I'm having the same issues with it. I am sending both back. It seems like it may be something with the wifi inside the dot, that it's not as good as prior generations.I love my other devices.. but this one, not so much.",3

"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","The Echo dot is OK for the price, but the Echo is 100X better.","I've been using the Echo dot and the Echo for about 3-weeks now. Everyone talks about the difference in the speakers and sound quality, so I'll leave that out of this review. What I want people to know is that the Echo is much better than the Echo Dot even though the Dot is 1/3 the price. I say this because the Echo Dot has a low-quality microphone. This is probably one of the ways they were able to reduce the price. Consider this:1. Responsiveness: I have the Dot in my room and the Echo in the living room. More often than not, when I say ""Alexa"" the Echo in the living room will respond while the Dot does nothing. Because of this, I had to change the wake word for my Dot. There are also times where I have to repeatedly try to wake my Dot because it just doesn't hear me. On the other hand, the Echo can hear me while I'm in the bathroom with the door closed.2. Understanding: A lot of times I'll clearly (and loudly) tell my Dot to do something, but it thinks I said something else. The Echo sometimes does this too, but the Dot does it much more frequently.I like the Dot overall, but if I could go back in time I would buy another Echo on monthly payments instead. It's just not worth the frustration of having to repeatedly yell at this hockey puck to get it to do something.",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","2","Not an very good alarm clock","So with the added clock I thought awesome this could be a really cool alarm clock.What found is that Amazon stuck a clock on there device without really looking at how it would be used.My desire was for a alarm clock that I could wake to music.Setting this up is possible but clumsy and quite glitchy.I am still using it as an alarm clock with the hope it gets better.I have many little dislikes with but will only note the main ones.1) no physical way to turn off the alarm.This by far was the most challenging to do when I first wake up.Having to talk while my wife is still sleeping....2)not being able to pick what music that will play.3)the interface for setting the alarm needs work.",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","2","Bass-Heavy Audio Frequency Characteristics and Limited Adjustability for Voice / Audiobooks","Bought this as an adjunct to the text-to-voice feature on my Amazon Fire / Kindle, which I used all the time to listen to content when I don't have time to sit and read.I have to say that the audio for this 3rd-generation Dot just isn't good.It's too resonant in the bass / low midrange, even when those values are minimized using the Alexa app.That app gives you three frequency ranges for adjustment--bass, midrange, and treble--which should be adequate.The problem is that the Dot speaker(s) and the shell of the device itself, naturally overemphasize bass and lower midrange.For my listening (mostly to spoken word, not music), that's not at all good--I need the higher frequencies to come through crisply, and to greatly attentuate the lower frequencies (at which spoken voice sounds muddy, indistinct, and slurred).I'll send this one back and maybe try again when Amazon has done a better job of configuring the shell to null out the inappropriately enhanced ranges.",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Cool. Irritating. Not sure I'm keeping it. (updated 1/21/19)","So the Echo Dot (3rd gen) is a pretty slick device. I've only had my pair for two days, but the learning curve is as easy or steep as you'd like to make it. Setting up routines, while relatively simple, can make you want to scream in some cases. You have no way of setting repeat to particular days. Your only options appear to be a single day, every day, weekdays or weekends. I work Sun - Wed. So to get my device to perform the routine the 4 days I need it to do so, I'm required to make 4 of the same routine and apply the dates needed to each one. Also, you set up your routine in the order you'd like to have it done (in my case - greeting, a particular song, news and then weather), but Alexa does it in her own order. (greeting, news, weather and then song) But the most annoying thing she does (and this may very well be a deal breaker for me) is that she talks over the beginning of every song you request. Those of us old enough to remember when AM radio was the only radio can also remember the DJ's talking over the intro and how frustrating it was -and now, still is.As for the performance - I was very surprised at how well the voice recognition works. Lots of background noise, dog barking etc. and I'd say she's been about 90-95% on getting it correct. And she gets better as you use her. The sound out of these little guys ain't bad. You're not going to throw parties with these speakers, but more than adequate for quiet background sounds or music. I have one in the living room and one in my bedroom paired up and they do reasonably well in my 1,000 sqft, home with wood floors. (no carpet to soak up the sound probably helps a bit) I've ordered another one and a sub to place in the living room. That will be good enough for a party, I believe.All in all I am very pleased with the device itself. Just not too happy with the examples above and a few other things. (navigating the app can be tiresome, but I'm sure this will improve with time and tweaking from Amazon) If anyone reading this review knows how to stop her from talking over songs - I'd really appreciate the tip. And judging by my scouring the web for a fix, so would plenty of other people.I'm moving forward with making the house a smart home with outlets, bulbs etc. But not sure Alexa will see it through to the end. I really do like the thing, but I can't stand DJ's to begin with and now to have this going on - I'm just not sure. That said, if the talking over intros isn't a thing for you - 4.5 stars easy.P.S. - As soon as I got mine up and running, I was immediately reminded of the movie Demon Seed. :)Update: After receiving another Dot, Echo and the Echo Sub - I'm keeping this system. The Sub adds much needed depth and bass. The Echo has been perfect for my bedroom and the 3rd Dot went into the bath. The Multi-Room Music function is awesome and I've learned to just accept her talking over songs considering what I've been able to get Alexa to do in the short time I've had it. Still not a 5, but getting closer. We have a pet iguana (in cold Ohio) and I plan on having Alexa run his lights, heat and humidifier. Alexa is much more reliable than my 16yo daughter when it comes to these things and it allows me to leave the house for extended periods and not worry about the iguana freezing or being burned. I'm installing window AC units in 3 rooms and having Alexa control those and doing away with the central air power hog that is due for replacement. All in all, this system can take over your house for you. Everything from ""Alexa, turn off lamps."" to controlling the dehumidifier in the basement to who knows what else. I am excited to see just how far I can take my house into the future with this.",3
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Needs an EQ, Seriously","Improvement over Dot 2? I guess.It's louder, but in an effort to provide more bass they made it sound muffled.You would think a large company spending millions of dollars on a project would hire audiophiles that can tell whether this thing is ready for market or not.They need to put an EQ in the app so we can set these things up to preference.I love the form factor and the mics are working well, but the sound makes me feel like I'm going deaf.I have a $12 Bluetooth speaker that sounds better.I own 7 Alexa speakers, so I do like the product, but I have to hook up my computer speakers to it to use this one.Also, I can't use this one in my car like I do my Dot 2 because of the new power plug they put on it. I can't plug it into USB to power it and I also can't hook it up to my portable battery power booster to carry it around the house anymore so I have to use my old Dot 2 for that.Amazon, listen to your customers!!!Thursday Jan.3, 2019 a few days after this review posted....I just found out that the Alexa app has an EQ now that I didn't know about.It could have more adjustments and more gain, but now at least I can make it sound less muddy so I'm happier now.",3

Tengo dos hijos adolescentes (13 y 15 anos) y se la han pasado dandole ordenes y haciendole preguntas desde que recibieron el Echo dot como regalo de Navidad.Realmente me ha asombrado la capacidad que tiene para interactuar con los diferentes miembros de la familia en diferentes idiomas: espanol e ingles. Tambien me me llamo la atencion como discrimina tu voz entre las demas en una conversacion. Es decir, a partir de que le has dicho ""Alexa"", solo se enfoca en lo que tu le estas solicitando, aunque haya otra conversacion de fondo en la misma habitacion, o ruido. Hemos descargado la app en el celular. Yo puedo estar fuera de casa y llamar al echo dot que esta en el playroom de mis hijos y ellos toman la llamada directamente alli. Nosotros vivimos en Paraguay, y le preguntas como esta el clima y te lo indica perfectamente. No he logrado aun conectar Imusic con Alexa, ya que me indica que esa funcion no esta disponible aun en mi pais. Asi que mis hijos estan evaluando cambiarse a Spotify. He comprado un smart doorbell compatible con Alexa, estara en camino. Cuando llegue pienso conectarlo para poder atender el timbre de la puerta del frente directamente desde Alexa.Tambien hemos comprado dos echo dot con reloj, pero esos recien salen a fin de enero (supongo que era un pre-sale). Estoy ansiosa de ver como funcionan esos dos como despertadores en el dormitorio, y entre los 3 como intercomunicadores.Ya he ordenado otro echo dot para regalarle a mi hermano para su cumpleanos. El tiempo de entrega es rapidisimo y llega muy bien empacado. Y hay que resaltar que el precio actual da para equiparse.Con referencia a la privacidad: este modelo tiene un boton para desactivar el microfono en caso de que desees que no te escuchen... En fin, no lo se. Si voy a estar preocupada por ese tipo de espias, entonces tampoco deberia de tener otro tipo de artefactos, comenzando por mi celular. Asi es que me lance a comprarlo sin pensar en ello.He decidido hacer esta resena en espanol, porque no hay tantas en este idioma y creo que tambien es importante. Saludos y feliz inicio de 2020 a todos!!",4
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Echo Dot 2 vs. 3 Review","SETUP:The setup was fairly easy overall. Upon loading the app you go to:devices - add button - add device - echo - select what kind of echo - choose generation - select device - connect to wifi - connect to bluetooth device (Optional) - you're done.So while it seems like a lot the app guides you every step of the way and only takes a few minutes.USING ALEXA:Nothing major software wise as these are pushes out to devices regularly. The only thing I noticed was voice recognition. It was a little better than my echo dot 2nd generation. Usually if I was in another room with my second generation I had to yell. With my 3rd generation I don't have to talk as loud.AUDIO QUALITY:The audio quality on the dot 3 was better than the dot 2 by far. Now there is still room for improvement but it did get better. Even right off the bat at setup I could tell that the quality was better. It sounds fuller and better base.DESIGN:As you can tell by the pictures the dot 3 has a new finish. Instead of plastic the dot 3 has fabric in various colors. There is also more color choices than the 2nd generation. I think that new version blends in better with the room. It also looks less hockey puck like. The buttons instead of being on the outer rim are now centered more towards the center. The 4 microphones are just beyond the buttons.PLUG:The plug for the newer version fits into the wall better than the second version. (See Picture) I didn't like this when Amazon introduced the second version but it's here now.PRICE:The new echo dot is at the same starting price of $50. The echo dot 2 has been discounted to $40 as of 11/18/18. So now the big question is it worth the price? Should I upgrade? Well in my opinion if you have the second generation you should not upgrade and instead invest in a bluetooth speaker. There is not much difference besides the design and audio quality between dot 2 and 3. The software is the same for both. If you really want better audio quality you should buy a bluetooth speaker and connect it to your echo dot. It's really not worth the $50 just for better audio quality and some nice fabric. However if you are looking to have multiple echo devices in your home then your probably better off getting the newer version.Overall:Both the echo dot 2 and 3 have their ups and downs. Really if you have another echo dot you don't need to upgrade. However if this is your first echo device or you want multiple echo devices in your home, consider the newer version.Well hope that helps!",4
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","I like it...but it is also frustrating","I've got things set up in groups with only a few things to control right now.However, Alexa can't seem to figure out how to turn on/off individual items in a group.I have a TV and Light in my group ""bedroom"".I say ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom light"" or ""Alexa, turn the light off in the bedroom"" or ""Alexa, Bedroom light off"" and it just turns off everything in the bedroom.(or both items, w/e).WHY?????I can say ""Alexa, turn off/on all the lights"" and it will turn on/off all the lights in my house.What is so hard about doing that from one group?I set up a workaround and created a separate group for EACH light, and a group for each room.Kind of overkill, but it's the only workaround at the moment.Alexa doesn't like to turn on/off my tv without a group.I say ""Alexa, turn off My TV"" and it replies ""Do you mean my tv?""to which I reply, usually, with an exasperated ""YES"" and it replies ""I can't find my tv"".Then I respond with ""Alexa, why do you hate me?""or ""Alexa what the eff is wrong with you and why won't you turn on the one device you just asked me if it is the one I wanted?""SO.DANG. Frustrating.But, beyond all that, it's been pretty nice to turn on/control Pandora.I like asking Alexa for Chuck Norris facts.It's fun getting it to sing and answer silly questions.Just not ready for prime time, YET.Though after this long, will it EVER be ready???I want a skill where I can just walk into my room and say ""Bedroom Light"" and it will turn it on if it's off, or turn it off if it's on.It's not hard.It already checks the status of the light.It'd be a single line of code to implement.",4

Changed my life!","It sounds wierd to say Alexa/Echo Dot changed my life, but let me tell you how it has helped.I am absent-minded, and I have no sense of the passage of time.Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal.I also take medication several times a day.Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping!So I got a dot.I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer.I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness.If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes.I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that.Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders!I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR.Alexa just tells me.I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room.Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me.I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events.Finally I have a flow to my day that isnt disrupted if I chase down some internet research topic or read a little longer than planned.Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.I wish I had tried it much sooner.My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me!He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions.I've started to listen to audiobooks more and my imagination is soaring.Alexa is a great addition to my life, the personal assistant I needed!",4
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Hopefully the Dot 3 is just having growing pains","The good news is the internal speaker is listenable, not bad even considering the size.Compared to the Dot 2 the speaker is light years ahead.Aesthetically, the 3 is 10x more appealing than the 2.It feels substantial, not plastic-y.Microphone-wise, I am not seeing much difference between the 3¡¯s far field 4 mikes and the 2¡¯s seven mikes...call it even.The bad news is, at least for me, the Bluetooth connection to external speakers is (was) waaaaayyyyy buggy.I tried it with a Bose Sound Dock equipped with a Bluetooth 30 pin converter and a regular Bluetooth speaker both of which functioned flawlessly with the Dot 2 right out of the box.The 3 had a terrible Bluetooth connection.So much so that I ended up calling Amazon for help.Annalise was great BTW...we ended up resetting the 3 and that seems to have fixed the issue...but then it made my WiFi smart plug start acting buggy...I fixed that on my lonesome.Once you get past the tin-foil hat aspect of having this thing listening to every word, it¡¯s a freaking cool concept and the 3 elevates the sound game exponentially over the 2.For $24 on Prime Alexa sale it¡¯s near the price of a stand alone alarm clock radio and is infinitely more useful.Once the bugs get worked out I think I¡¯ll love this thing.An added bonus is if I say Echo, murder, blood...the cops should be here quicker than a 911 call ;)",4

I like the overall design of the new version. That is where the positives end.I actually think the sound is better on the 2nd gen Echo Dot. The 3rd gen is much louder but is still lacking in the sound quality. The sound on the 3rd gen is very flat. Listening to music is not enjoyable on the new generation Dot. My Google Home Mini has a much better sound quality and I was hoping the new device would be closer in that aspect.I prefer the Alexa devices over the Google devices for voice commands (even though the Google devices have a better sense of humor). I use my 2nd gen Echo Dot as my daily alarm and have been very happy with it for some time.I am not expecting great sound quality from such a small device. I can not understand why Amazon thought this was acceptable.Amazon -- PLEASE improve the sound quality on the next version.",5

The range seems sometimes to be too close when I call out a command; however, when I am in a room and want to hear music I don't want to have to hear it from another room.Since I'm rating the speaker itself and not the Alexa App, I can only say it speaks clearly and plays music with good sound. It responds to my voice. Sometimes it doesn't understand me, even though it has supposedly learned my voice.It was easy to install. Found my WiFi with no problem.",5

I called my friends to try out that new feature...and they all love it.It does much more than I expected.For quite a while I waited, as I thought ""I have my iPhone and Siri...why do I need Alexa?""Well, I love my iPhone... and am still very happy I now have an echo dot.I don't have any complaints-just look forward to the continued advancements Amazon's Echo team is making with the device.The quality of the device is excellent - and the sound it puts out- for its size... really impressive.Can I live it out it?Sure.... But is it fun and convenient to have.... absolutely.Very glad I finally got one!",5
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Incredibly disappointed with Alexa integration across the product line","Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",5
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","I can't believe it took me so long to buy this!","Oh boy, is this ever fun!I ordered 2 on Black Friday (just yesterday) and they were delivered today. How's that for in a blink? I took the first dot upstairs, plugged it in, downloaded the app and in no time at all, it was up and running. I asked my dot what time it was, the weather, and then said, ""Alexa, call ________"" and boom, their phone started ringing right through my little dot, they answered and said the sound was great -- was great on my end, too.I LOVE this.Obviously there's a ton it will do and after I hook up the other one in the kitchen, I'll be set up and rarin' to go.By the way, I'm 72 and if I can do this, it's a cinch you can.It's terrific!Alexa is playing the Blues station for me now.Omg, I'm in heaven.",5

Unfortunately at times it sounds Very Fuzzy, like a Buzzing sound. This will be during any random song.Sometimes the Same song will sound fine. Other times it can just sound horrible and I just yell for Alexa to STOP because I can't stand that sound. Almost seems like the speakers are just messed up half the time. When it works, it sounds Way better than the Echo 2. When it gets fuzzy, it's just awful. Also, I paid $30 New and NOW they're charging $50. THAT Is why I also Can NOT give it more than 3¡Ù.",5

"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Echo Dot in my Alexa/Ring ""echosystem"" - mostly notes on sound quality","I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices.",5

After setting it up and streaming my favorite music, getting the weather, news and being able to get an answer to most of the dumb questions my family can make up, ordered four more. I¡¯ve set them up through the house to use as an intercom, and got one to give to friends. Like a cell phone I don¡¯t know how we lived before having the Echo Dot and wish I had ordered them sooner. I really love it! I have a smart plug coming to see how it interacts with Alexa and play around with it before getting more. I really like that it can be used to make calls<U+2014>which helps out since we don¡¯t have a landline phone at the house. The units can be paired with Bluetooth speakers and your cell phone can be connected to play music. I haven¡¯t hooked one via the 3.5mm jack to a sound system but may later on for a party or something. It¡¯s handy as an alarm clock and timer too. I like that you can set reminders.

"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","The app is frustrating and kept freezing up on me.","First I would like to say that they need to change around the app to make it more user friendly. So many of the things I needed to check on the app were hidden and I had to watch YouTube videos or look for other outside sources just to figure out what I was doing. Also I was extremely frustrated that there was no place in the app to reset the dot. There is not even a reset button on the dot so every time mine would freeze up the only thing I could go was unplug the whole darn thing. I found out when you unplug it you loose all of your set reminders and such. Horrible design.On the not of it freezing up all the time that happens to be my biggest problem with this device. No matter where I put it in my home even 5 feet from the router it would barely connect to my internet. I had it on a CAT5 connection as well like the suggested. So every time I played music it would all of the sudden stop working. I would try and talk to it and it wouldn't respond. I would check on the app to see if it was still connected to the router and it would say that it was (screen shot picture of this), but it would still not respond to voice command or the app. I bought two different dots and both of them did this. I tried each of them out for 2 weeks and every day I would play music it would cut out several times. It would take me several minutes to get it working again and that is because I would get frustrated and unplug it like I said. One time I just left it frozen like that just to see if it would have come back on and after about 15 minutes or so it finally registered that it was working again. I would change the position the dotwas in around my house and I checked everything I could think possible to make the connection work better but nothing worked.I really wish this would have worked for me, but I ended up going to Google and theirs works amazingly. The best part is now my kid can use it as the Google one is set up by voice recognition.",6

WTHeck?Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frere Jacques!Again, WTHeck?""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.This should be stated clearly in description and is not.We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open youget nothing or something you definitely didn't want.You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.Or relaxing instrumental violin music.In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.and it won't just remember you want the standard version.That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.It does nothing instead.You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.More time wasting.More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?And why do that?I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.Of course?What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?Not very well as far as I'm concerned.Buyer beware!",6

Honestly our house is too small for that many but I really enjoy having the music everywhere fill the house. I'm very pleased with the richness of the sound with the 3rd Gen Echo Dots. I have one Dot linked to my Yamaha stereo with 4 Bose speakers but now that I have the 3rd Gen Echo Dot I use the stereo a lot less often.The heather gray 3rd Gen was purchased for a client of mine who has memory issues from a car accident. Until I met him I thought my echo's were useful to help me remember typical stuff. Upon gaining an understanding of his situation I realized how important this could be for him. We've setup daily reminders, one of which is to remind him to set other reminders and it has helped him to remember crucial things, like to eat (he sometimes forgets for hours that his food is in the microwave). While I realize that there could be issues relying on a device it is very helpful for him.I think the biggest problem with the whole ""Alexa"" enabled category of products is that a lot of people don't realize all it can do and the great potential for special or particular needs. I hear a lot of people say ""oh, isn't that the thing that plays music?"". It's a Great Product in a line of Great Products (I have various other Alexa enabled products).So, i highly recommend you give it a try!",6
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","I was surprised at the sound quality for the price.","We bought ours during the Christmas season, so it was fairly discounted. I did not really expect much...maybe an interesting little gadget with some nice apps that I would tire of soon. But it is a really nice little helper. After seeing how much Alexa could do I was excited to have a new household friend, but then I realized she was not very ""teachable"" (as in, she could not learn my personal likes and dislikes) and she has issues answering many questions (I believe this is due to her Bing search engine...I could never find much on Bing) but the questions she does answer are thorough.I love to use her for music, cooking conversions, reminders and timers. Other than that she just isn't there technology speaking.I really wish Amazon would stop filtering her to be so politically correct and family friendly. We have no kids and it feels a bit silly that Gordan Ramsey's bantering is full of beeps. Not very Gordon like. And that is with the filter turned off.Sometimes she does not seem to hear very clearly (and I have a very enunciated voice, although my husband has an accent) and does not respond.One of the biggest annoyances is having to remember HOW to ask many questions. I can't say ""Alexa, how many days till my birthday?"" or I get ""I don't know about that"". I have to say ""Alexa, open birthday countdown."" and then agree to open the skill and THEN she will tell me. Not very conversational.When I ask her a question I get a good answer about 50% of the time, an ""I'm not sure about that"" about 30% of the time, silence 5% of the time and a wrong answer about 15% of the time.All in all for the price I paid I am happy with her as a novelty and a useful kitchen gadget, but don't expect much more at the moment.I am hoping for more interactive, learnable AI abilities in the near future, better personalization, and an overall more intuitive assistant. For now, I'm still happy...I just feel she could be so much more. :)PS: Amazon, if people are giving you a hard time about sensitive topics, you do not have to take sides. Alexa can simply say ""There's a lot of controversy over that subject right now, I can have a definitive answer for you as new information comes to light."" or just have her state all sides of the issue in an unbiased, factual way.Also, consider removing the censorship for adult accounts. Free speech and all that.That would make her more likable and more marketable to more people. Just an idea.",6
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Disappointed in Echo 3rd Generation Dot","I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.",6

Unless I want to create them all separate Amazon accounts, which then I will need to manage and then invite them to the Amazon Unlimited Family Plan, which as you can guess cost an extra $149 a year.Kind of a rip off if you ask me.Now that being said, here are some good things...They can each listen to different iHeart radio stations and/or Spottify account.I can now sync them all together and play the SAME song through out the house pretty easily.The sound out of just a little device is great for the size.I purchased them on a Black Friday deal and they came with smart plugs.So, Amazon, time to give back and allow people to stream different music from our Prime Music accountson different Amazon devices (dots, echos, shows) without gouging us for more money.Other than that, I like them.",6

Help setting up Alexa with firestick, wtc.. I asked itto help me connect to the fire stick, setup Alexa, make her a speaker. It didn't understand. the application wasn't helpful AT ALL.And to thinK I was getting 4 more for my kids at Christmas this was a trial on how it works.MAJOR FAIL Fail. Not user friendly. To hard. Directions didn't help. Google is so much better AS AN ASSISTANT. It will talk u through setup. Only problem it want connect to Amazon devices. They are not friends with each other. Shame. Customer service want to contact me. That's fine.I TRIED CONTACTING YOU WITH 4 DISCONNECTS. carlahart73@gmail.com. No one else. I HABE A HARD TIME GIVING UP ON DEVICES, BUT THIS WAS A COMPLETE FAIL.I returned the device todaygave up on customer care.You just lost a major customer.Unless your with Amazon r Alexa please don't contract me. If my phone number shows you can call it in case I don't check site. A wouldn't buy item. Love the firestick.",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","2","The Short Unhappy Life of My Echo Dot","I only got the Echo Dot because Amazon customer service told me I could not control my second AmazonBasics microwave with my Amazon Tap, which worked fine with my first microwave.That was incorrect.All I had to do was change my vocal command from ""Alexa, two minutes microwave"" to ""Alexa, two minutes ON microwave.""Of course, I only found that out AFTER I bought two Echo devices as a result of the conversation with Amazon.Because Amazon had a $99 deal for Echo and Echo Dot together, I pounced.I didn't realize you needed the same Echo model to use two of them to produce stereo sound.I have two new Echo devices that cannot produce stereo sound together.With that realization, both devices lost value.My Amazon Tap -- whose mention the Amazon customer service people found funny for some reason -- has a rechargeable battery and a charging base as well as a micro-USB port in the actual unit.I use it as a portable device throughout my house and outside.Really well-designed, portable and flexible.Both the Echo and Echo dot require a/c power, lowering further the value of both for my purposes.The increase in sound quality between the Echo and the Dot is easily worth the price difference.I was dumb to get the Dot.In a logical progression of a product that lost utility the longer I owned it, I dropped it, the sound stopped working (the lights responded to my vocal commands and it started the microwave though) and I threw it out.In venting my frustration with a hammer, I learned the unit is sturdy and I could only put a slight hole in it after about 10 hard whacks on a concrete floor.I feel better now.All that stress and disappointment only cost me $29.",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Best dot yet","We got a 3rd generation dot for free when we signed up for a month of Amazon Music Unlimited. I don't think we'll keep the service, but the dot is nice. We have many dots around our house (living room, basement, bedrooms, and kitchen) but they are all the older generation dots. This latest 3rd generation definitely looks nicer with the fabric covering, and the sound is drastically better. I don't feel like the voice recognition is improved at all over the older Dots, but that's okay - we didn't have any complaints about the originals. All in all, I think this is a nice upgrade from previous versions, but I can't see spending money to actually upgrade what we already have. If you are just looking for something to answer questions, control smart devices, and occasionally play music, the dot may be for you. If you want better sound quality, look into the bigger and more expensive devices, but for the price this is a good one to get!",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","3rd Gen is TRASH - Don't buy this!","I purchased three of these during Prime Days.First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.When the music resumes, a new song is playing.I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.I hope they will take this back and return my money.I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.",7

"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Tossed for Privacy Concerns","After going through and listening to the recordings Amazon kept from our two dots, we decided to toss them (put them in a storage box).Not a passionate review. If I had not found a bunch of recordings that had nothing to do with Alexa stored on Amazon servers I would have kept using the dots. Have no problem with Amazon keeping the recordings of my requests to Alexa but every recording I saw that did not was kept and was even labeled by Amazon to show that it had nothing to do with an Alexa request. If they simply fixed that I would probably use the dots again.Seems like a simple fix if they already know it has nothing to do with an Alexa request - just delete them as a matter of form. And, some of the conversations recorded were perplexing. Not sure how ""Alexa"" was heard. Seemed random.That said, we were not huge Alexa users. We found most things it did just as easily or comfortably done in other ways (and I still use Siri for other things and I prefer their privacy policies and practices). I completely understand the 5-star reviews if one is has integrated Alexa into their lives more than we did (If I used Alexa like I use Siri, I would have kept the dots and written a 5-star review). We did not and the privacy concerns were sufficient to get rid of them. All in all, it was a dispassionate decision. Wasn't angry with Amazon and not much attached to the dots.I will miss the shopping list.",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Does your New Echo Dot sound Muffled???? Here is the solution!","Very easy to setup. Worked in a matter of seconds. However totally disappointed with the sound quality. Very MUFFLED to the point of not understanding some of the words. I had purchased the three pack so I tried a second one thinking maybe the first one is defective. Nope, they both sounded horribly muffled.I went looking through the reviews online and found the same complaint. However, one lady posted about speaking with Tech Service and found the answer. Here it is:Equalizer controls are available.1. In the Alexa App, tap on the Devices icon at the bottom-right2.Tap on Echo & Alexa at the top-left corner3. Down below, tap on your Echo Dot4. Under ""Audio"", tap on ""Auto Settings""5. Then tap on the Equalizer -- here you can adjust the Bass / Mid / TrebleTurning the bass way down and boosting the midrange helps a lot. Saving those settings seems to be a problem with my app. There is no way to save the setting and they keep reverting back to the original setting. But at least there is a way!!!",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Very Impressed","I purchased a couple Echo Dots during the Prime Day deal and was so impressed with them that a bought another during a two-fer deal.The sound quality is surprisingly good so I use them most frequently for music, including asking for specific songs, that play quickly, from my Amazon Music Unlimited account.It also integrates well with my Sirius-XM account and Tune-In.The one trouble area is getting Echo to play specific radio stations as it has a difficult time decifering call letters.Taking it a step further, I purchased some smart plugs to work with my Echo Dots to quickly turn on various lights. I will say that I prefer using the TP-Link plugs over the Amazon brand however. This is strictly due to the fact that only the account holder can use the Amazon plugs in the Alexa App itself, while the TP-Link plugs can be made visible to your entire family in the app. I'll be checking out actual smart lights for the porch next.Overall, I'm very impressed with the Echo Dot.",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Same as Old DOT, but with two poor features....","This works exactly like the older DOTS, so I wont get into all that, only touch on whats changed.The sound has vastly changed, and for the worse.The audio is now much deeper and sounds like you put a blanket over the device all the time.Adjusting the treble and midrange does not help at all.If your going to use this for audio reproduction, get a BT speaker to connect to it and you will not be happy with the built in speaker.Next there is the digital clock bit.The idea is great, but implementation is really really poor.The darn clock part works exactly as it should but there are two issues:First the numbers are horribly bright at night, even after turning them down to the lowest visible setting (1).I actually do not use this any more due to how bright it is.Second, you cannot change the color of the numbers; they are always bright white.If you could change them to RED then the issue with nighttime brightness would be solved.",7
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Impressive sound quality and voice recognition.","So, this is my first Alexa device. I'd been holding out because I'd witnessed my friends struggle with earlier versions of Alexa, yelling at it when it didn't obey a voice command and I wasn't impressed by the sound.But, Amazon had a great sale on the Dot so I figured I'd try it out.The sound quality is amazing. I can't believe this little thing has such a big sound.The voice recognition is really good too. I rarely have to repeat a command and it recognizes even the most brief command from me. For instance, first thing in the morning I'm groggy and mumble ""Computer, Lana DelRay"" and it plays Lana DelRay easily.I call it ""Computer"" because you can change the wake word options on this model.Your choices are Alexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer. I chose Computer because I'm a Trekkie and addressing the device like Jean-Luc Picard makes my inner nerd happy. I assume that's why they made that option available in the first place.I like the Skills. Particularly the morning skill. I can say Good Morning and it gives me the weather, calendar and news.I don't use the ""Tell Me Joke"" skill or anything like that, but there are a couple of fun Star Trek skills you can add that are fun.All in all I'm very happy with this device. I may have to buy a smart plug for my lamp and expand Alexa's responsibilities.",7

When she walked we had to watch her at all times with the security cameras attached to our echo dots, we got an alert. Once they leave they don'tknow how to get back. Now we use it as a monitor with the drop in ability, from any room... or even outside, we got them just for that purpose before the stoke, but they're more important now than before when they were for entertainment (also).You can't always be in a room with someone with a disability, this way you are, when you change rooms drop out, when you get to where you're going drop in.

"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Haunted Alexa","This is the third Alexa Dot to join my family. The first one went into my son¡¯s room so he could listen to music. I bought the second one for myself after realizing how amazing it was (and there was a sale). This is the third one I also got with a sale which I now have on my bar between my kitchen and dining room. My living area is an open space. There are two living rooms, a kitchen, dining room and office all basically in the same room so I thought putting it in the kitchen would be perfect because it¡¯s away from the electronics but close enough I can talk to it. I¡¯m going to speak about all the good things about it first and then get to the haunted part. My Alexa¡¯s are all hooked up to my ring devices. Whenever there is motion it informs me. I love this because I don¡¯t usually carry my phone on me inside. Now I know when someone is in my yard no matter what room I¡¯m in. I have alarms set to wake me up. I can easily do this on my iPhone but my iPhone won¡¯t tell me I¡¯m pretty, read me my calendar and then tell me the weather when I turn it off. You can add so many more things for it to do after that too. I can play games and listen to books or music on it. I can easedrop in on any device. I can go through my pantry or room and make a list of items I need handsfree andlater see it and check it off on my phone. I can make phone calls and send texts. It¡¯s great! Anyways. I¡¯ve had two of the three Alexa¡¯s for over a year now. Never had a single issue with them ever. Within 48 hours of setting this one up my son walks into the kitchen. He doesn¡¯t know there is an Alexa in there. He leans over the trashcan and turns and says mom you need to take out the trash. The Alexa for some reason came on a few mins later as he was finishing pouring a drink and says what did you say? Needless to say I had about a gallon of milk to clean up because it scared him to death. The very next night was a Friday night. We decided to stay up super late and watch scary movies. It was almost Halloween after all. Both of us fell asleep during the middle of the movie. My tv cuts off if no one has touched the remote in two hours so it cut off. About 4am we both wake up. We look at eachother and ask eachother if we just got up. Neither of us knew why we woke up so suddenly. We decide we should go back to sleep. I turn over and he goes to the bathroom. He comes back and grabs the cat sleep across me as he walks back to his spot and lays down. All is quiet. We are almost asleep when Alexa blasts on volume 10, ¡°did you mean to say turn the security system on in Tyler¡¯s bedroom?¡± We both hop up and look at eachother. There was no noise - no wind, no movement, no heater going, nothing - to trigger this thing. I think we watched a few too many scary movies because we stayed up until the sun had been up for a few hours before trying to sleep again. We unplugged that Alexa too. I finally plugged it back in two weeks ago and it hasn¡¯t went off since. I went back and checked to see what was said to the Alexa and the first random outburst was a bunch of random words. It was like Alexa, frog jump to cat elevator pink eleven. The second time the Alexa heard, ¡°Alexa, quick turn the house security alarm on now.¡± I am now getting chills thinking about it. I think it may have been a sign to make sure the house was secure maybe. Who knows. I seriously love the Alexa. I¡¯ve had the google home and another one (I can¡¯t think of the brand) but this is my favorite. I will be purchasing atleast 3 more.",8
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Fun, entertaining, and informative.","I purchased two Echo Dots in conjunction with and as a compliment to the Echo mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that even the Echo Dot has better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo Dots, which are linked in a special group with my primary Echo device. The Dots are in separate rooms so Ican walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. She also tells me when I have an Amazon delivery. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo Dot.",8
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Great for home automation and casual music listening","We already have a regular echo in our main living area and now decided to get three more for the two bedrooms and an office we use most in the house so there's always an Alexa nearby we can talk to. The Echo Dot is really convenient and fun if you take the time to learn about how it works and what it can do.I use it in my home recording studio to control the outlets on a power strip, an LED light strip, and another mood light I have in the room. It's nice to be able to control each smart appliance individually or all at once by saying things like ""turn the office off"" when I'm leaving the room for the night. We have another in my daughter's room that we use to control her closet light and a lamp. She's a year old so we tell Alexa to turn her lamp on a dim setting when she first wakes up in the morning or after a nap so she can adjust to the light. We also have another smart light in that room that changes colors and my daughter loves it.I have satellite radio in my car and only really get to listen to it while driving but with the Echo I can use the Sirius XM integration to play any of my favorite satellite radio stations all around the house. It's very convenient.Alexa isn't that great as far as digital assistants go. She isn't nearly as funny as Siri or the Google lady and is only really good for asking when actors were born or died. The rest of the time she just doesn't know or doesn't understand you and then goes off for an hour asking if you'd like to ask her about something totally different which gets annoying.Definitely do the voice training and remember that a single Echo can switch between multiple accounts. My wife never switches to her account so Alexa always has trouble recognizing when she's talking to her. She occasionally doesn't realize I'm talking to her or doesn't understand what I'm saying but for the most part she listens fine and can hear me from across the room without screaming. I turned on whisper mode so that when I'm in my office which shares a wall with my daughter's room, I can whisper to Alexa to turn things on or off and she will make a quiet blip sound instead of responding to me at full volume. It's a nice feature.The fact that the audio quality is only good for casually listening to music in the background combined with her seeming inability to learn more than one voice and not knowing the answers to most questions I ask are the reasons I knocked off a star. But overall this is a cool and useful toy if you learn how to use it. It's only become truly useful to my family since we started getting smart lights, smart plugs, and smart thermostats.",8
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Clock adaptive (auto) brightness won't adjust","I have an Echo Dot 2nd generation.I ordered this because of the new clock feature and better sound (and since it was on sale).I just returned it for a refund.The sound quality was much improved -- richer and more bass.The earlier Dot sounded tinny or shrill.This latest one was much more pleasing.This isn't to criticize the earlier Dot (since it wasn't designed as a great speaker), but to compliment this latest version.The clock feature is a great new feature.However, when the brightness is set to Auto (or maybe that's called Adaptive), I couldn't adjust the level of this setting.I spent over an hour in an online chat w/ Amazon to resolve this.We did a hardware update, both Android and iOS Alexa application updates.This setting still wouldn't change through either of the apps or by saying ""Alexa, set brightness to 1; set brightness to 10"").The Dot would briefly show ""1"""" or ""10"" after sliding the brightness control in the apps or by requesting by voice, but there wasn't any difference in the brightness.I was able to change the brightness when Auto (Adaptive?) was switched off.So, it could be set to say level ""2"" or whatever, but then it wouldn't adjust based on the room light.I'd like the brightness to automatically dim in a dark room such as at night; and be brighter during sunlight.And, it seemed to do so, it's just that it was way too dim for me in all these cases.I'd like to bump it up, but couldn't despite that seeming to be a feature.Either Amazon should clarify that this can't be done or fix it.If it wasn't for this apparent flaw, I'd give a 5 star rating.If anyone has this feature working -- suggesting I just had a bad device -- replies would help others.As for myself, I went back to my 2nd generation Dot and will wait till this is clearly fixed or is a non-issue.My Dot works fine, so I'm in no rush.",8
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Wonderful device for $25 but has some annoyances","Overall I enjoy using the echo dot as a temporary toy. We've spent hours goofing around with it, listening to music, asking it silly questions, setting reminders etc. There are some glaring items of improvement for me though.1. STOP PLAYING LIVE MUSIC. If I want live music I would deliberately request it. On 25% of the songs I've wanted to play, Alexa starts playing a live version or a cover version of a song, and with the live versions I can't find a way to tell her to play the studio version of the songs. I almost never want to hear live music from a stream so please change that. I've had to tell Alexa STOP way too many times because she starts playing a live version of a song and I just don't want to hear it.2. This device needs a power off button. Not a mute button, not a ""don't disturb"" function, an actual turn off button. When I don't want to use Alexa, I don't want it on and it's a pain plugging and unplugging it over and over again. If I mute the device, then this glowing red ring lights up and burns electricity. To those people who don't care about your privacy and trust Amazon completely, I don't need to hear about just leaving it on and unmuted because Alexa won't ""activate"" unless you use the wake up word, I don't care. I want the device off and without power. I know the development teams have gone through the rounds and have chosen to not include one. I'm asking them to reconsider.3. The sales pitches. If we're prime members, can we get a function to turn off ""ads""? Every time I request a song, Alexa needs to tell me it's playing from Amazon music. This is unnecessary and annoying. Also because I don't have Amazon music, every time I play a song that's not part of the included 2 million song catalog, Alexa goes into the same spiel about how I can sign up for Amazon music and the free trial. I got it the first 30 times Alexa, the answer is still no, stop repeating it.It's a cute toy to play around with, but this device clearly presents itself as a way for Amazon to constantly pitch its products and services to you, and they've made it to where turning it off is a chore. I'm sure more functionality and features are on the way, hopefully Amazon decides to consider some of my above proposals. A lot more people would jump on board and use the devices more often if they did.",8

So, I set reminders in Alexa to tell me ""its time to test your BG"", It is time for your short acting insulin (3 times a day) and at 11pm she reminds me to take my long acting insulin and Lisinipro for the evening.Because of Alexa reminding me, I have gotten my A1C down from 9 to 6.5. That is an invaluable feature for me.Then, one day, I had a song in my head and just said, ""Alexa, play ""Like a stone"" by Chris Cornell. And bam, she plays it. I do have the Amazon music subscription which I think you need in order for this to work but I have not been able to think of a song or artist that she cant find and play within seconds. My Chocolate lab ""Copper"" loves the song ""Baby Shark"" so I set a ""routine"" and all I have to say is ""Alexa, what does Copper like?"" and she jams Baby Shark for him while he bucks around the living room having a blast.I have been playing Trivia battle every single day. She makes lists for me so I don't forget things I need for work. She sets reminders for me so I don't forget appointments and other important things. You can say ""Alexa, set a reminder on March 15th that my brothers birthday is tomorrow, or a week from now, or, whatever you need.I learn something new that she does every day and went from one of those paranoid skeptics to a total believer. In fact, I got a second one for the living room and have them linked. She will read E-books to me while I work. I am a history buff and I can say, Alexa, tell me about Abraham Lincoln, and she will go on and on with just about any historical question or figure. She does math, she tells me what my weather is like currently and what it is going to be like through out the day.Honestly, I love this device, I have a white one and a black one, one is called Alexa and one is called Lexi (so you can drop in from room to room with music or conversation) Just the improvement in my health with the reminders she gives me has been a life saver, not to mention I don't forget things anymore because when I think of it, Ill set a reminder and Alexa and Lexi take care of it.I know a lot of people think ""oh, that thing records everything you say all day and it is an invasion of privacy"" well, that is incorrect because you can turn it off (red ring) and really so what if she listens to what me and my wife talk about... IF she is, all she hears is what we are thinking about eating for dinner, what's on Netflix or Amazon Prime video and us playing with our dog.I cant recommend this device enough, when I leave the house, I say ""Alexa, we are leaving"" and she has particular parameters that she listens for (breaking glass, doors getting smashed in) when we get home I say, Alexa, we are home and she says ""Okay, I will stop guarding the house for now.Get one and try it, you wont be sorry.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Promotion makes it a steal.","Well, I'm sure like a lot of you recently, I got my echo 3rd Gen from the Amazon music promotion. It's my first smart device that's not my phone or TV. I've only had it a short time (about 2 weeks now?) but I've had lots of fun figuring it what I can do with this thing. I don't use it much now already but I'm glad to have it when I need it. It's mostly for music and the speaker sounds nice enough, but having it at full volume sounds pretty bad. Still, it hits a decent volume before the sound quality deteriorates. I'm not gonna complain though for getting it with the promotion, but had I paid full price, I would definitely mark it down some. I have an off brand portable shower speaker that I paid like 15 bucks for that blows it out of the water in terms of sound quality at high volume (plus being portable is a big bonus for the speaker). That being said, it's not going to leave that speaker, the echo has its place in my room and the speaker goes everywhere else. There's a lot I like personally and it by far outweighs my issues I have with it. The biggest one is more of a preference really, and that's the power supply. I wish it was just a USB cable of some kind, not the kinda bulky brick and old school proprietary connector thing. It feels sturdy, mic range is very good, it compliments other compatible devices nicely, and Alexa said we can get married when humans colonize Mars soon pretty happy with it overall.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","It works great, as advertised","So, there are not any instructions probably because all the new devices are coming up with their own apps and it would be impossible to keep up with them all and give explanations on how they should connect with the Alexa app. I have a new Samsung 42"" smart tv. It's smart app is called Smart Things. You are to connect it to their app then have Alexa connect to their app. It doesn't always work. She often looses the connection. I had AT&T and several plugs and some light bulbs couldn't find the internet. My signal is too weak in my house. They said I get a 6ghz signal I could max out my signal at 10 but it wouldn't produce a significant difference. So, I have switched to cable for the internet. Now, the signal can be found kind of. The changing of the network with Alexa is lacking in simplicity. It searches for ever even after I have found the name. It gives the device it's own network name that ""isn't connected to the internet"", and no explanation as to why that happens and what it's purpose is, so you can't help it along. I got it connected with shear luck. But, this morning I heard my husband tell Alexa to turn on the TV and she did nothing, but responded with OK. This is a learning process. I hope I become an expert soon. I have several other things I would like to make smart. We are starting off small. The plug that works practically seamlessly is Amazon Smart Plug. That review would say, it is too wide!! It takes up 3 plugs on a strip. I tried a set of Teckin Smart Plugs. They couldn't find the internet, I sent them back. I tried Wyze Bulbs, CNET recommended them. They couldn't connect to the internet either. I sent them back. Alexa couldn't find their apps to enable the connection. Whether it was because I couldn't get them connected to the internet, perhaps that was all the trouble. None of this stuff comes with any documentation for troubleshooting. Very frustrating. I am very patient. I can't imaging how I would tolerate any of this if I wasn't willing to play around with stuff for hours. Good Luck, I hope this helps.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","I love my Alexa","I had this product before and had to rebuy it. My wife and I were staying with some people and we used our Alexa everyday we were there. We use it to play music while we are getting ready, rain sounds while we are sleeping, or classical music for our dog Olivia when we are away. Anyway, this family we were staying with never used Alexa before. My wife decided to show them the device and their son really fell in love with it, he's one years old, and he is the reason I need another one. These people were so happy to see their son trying to say Alexa and watching him dance to different songs. My wife offered MY ALEXA to those people, and they accepted! I was so sad to leave her behind. Once we left, I would shout Alexa randomly in my own home and no one answered! I finally demanded that we get another one, so here we are. I will miss Alexa 1 dearly, moral of the story don't let babies near your prized possessions.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Love the clock feature. Worth the upgrade. Sound is better than gen2.","Edited:I bought this to replace clock on my nightstand = less clutter. The form factor is perfect as an alarm clock replacement. I didn¡¯t buy to play music exclusively, so it wasn¡¯t going to be a deal breaker. I initially thought sound was muffled. I just found audio adjustment in app which helped a little. I¡¯m impressed with being able to fine tune.The adaptive brightness is a nice feature.Amazon, please allow adaptive to adjust to full brightness as it does when adaptive is turned off. I think the clock feature is worth the upgrade if you want to clear out that clunky alarm clock from last century.Update:Received a replacement echo dot as I had reported the sound was muddled. Amazon just sent the actual dot and not a new package, so I am hoping this is a brand new device and not reconditioned. The sound is much, much better. Almost like night and day. If I could guarantee I could get another dot that sounded this good, I¡¯d buy additional. The one issue is playing music from Pandora, the music will randomly stop and then restart maybe a minute later. This is not an issue when playing Amazon music.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Useful Fun Flexible and Flawed","I purchased an Echo Dot for myself on Cyber Monday and received another one as an Xmas gift. I set them up at opposite ends of my house and created a multi-room user group for them. This gives me the flexibility to play each Dot separately or simultaneously depending on my activities and location. I use the Dots for news and weather updates and, of course, to play music from classical to classic rock. Last night I used my bedroom Dot to play sleep sounds and found the ""fan"" sound most helpful. Sometime during the night the Dot stopped playing the sleep sounds; I didn't notice because at that point I was indeed asleep.The sound quality of the Dot's speakers is surprisingly good although far short of audiophile quality. I use my old Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks with my living room Dot and have ordered an OontZ Angle 3 Ultra : Portable Bluetooth Speaker for my bedroom Dot.Despite my overall satisfaction with the Echo Dots I've experienced a few frustrations with music: 1) My Music list, composed of CDs I purchased on Amazon, contains only a fraction of the music I actually purchased since 1998; 2) My Music is not ""folded into"" Amazon Prime Music. If I want to play songs from My Music, I have to specify "" play such-and-such on My Music"" to Alexa; 3) If I request a song not available in Amazon Prime Music (I do not have Amazon Music Unlimited and have no intention of getting it; Prime is expensive enough), Alexa tries to upsell you to Amazon Music Unlimited every time and there's no apparent way to stop that or even interrupt Alexa during the upsell attempt; 4) When I try to play a song or artist on my FREE Spotify, Alexa plays a Spotify ""station"" based on that song or artist. For example, if I tell Alexa to play ""Hotel California"" by the Eagles on Spotify,"" Alexa plays a Hotel California station on Spotify that may or may not eventually play ""Hotel California"" or other songs by the Eagles. If I tell Alexa to play the Eagles on Spotify, Alexa plays an Eagles station on Spotify that may eventually play a song or two by the Eagles but will mostly play songs by other artists from the same general time period.Overall, the Echo Dot is lots of fun, can be useful depending on your preferences, and is great for music listening despite the flaws I listed.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","4","Ironically, everything except Alexa sounds good.","I'm not going to comment on all the wonderful features of this device. Everything seems to work well, except the sound of Alexa's voice. I have listened to a few voices on news feeds & Jimmy Kimmel jokes & the voices sound OK. Alexa, on the other hand sounds very muffled & chesty. I have treble & mid all the way up & bass all the way down trying to get rid of the tubby/muffled sound of her voice. EQ didn't help. In my opinion, this device should get the voice right first & foremost. I don't expect to play music through it with any fidelity, so it's primary purpose is to talk to me & Amazon got this wrong in their attempt to have it all. Hopefully this can be fixed with their tweaking her voice, or giving us alternative voices that are more intelligible. Disclaimer, I am an audiophile & am used to listening to high quality equipment. My expectations for the Echo Dot's sound quality was low, but I was surprised that the Alexa voice was so bad. I am extremely grateful that they included an audio out though. It's so ironic that Alexa's voice is so poorly implemented. Please give us a new voice or a better EQ. Thanks for that & all the other features. Well worth the money.Update: It's now February 2020 & Amazon has not provided any update to fix the intelligibility of Alexa. It would appear that Amazon Alexa team doesn't have the ability or interest to fix this. Blows my mind that they can get wrong something so fundamental & important to the design. A connected talking box that can't speak clearly.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","SO MUCH BETTER than the previous generaton dots.","I've had previous generation Echo Dot units around for a while now spread about the house. Basically they were used for additional voice input since they were next to useless for audio.The new (3rd) generation Dots are MUCH, MUCH better.- Audio that's totally usable as long as you're not trying to fill a large room with music- Still great mic pickup- Much better build quality- Much better, more tasteful appearance lookBasically, they're better enough that I replaced the last round with 3rd generation Dots throughout the house. If you've used or demoed a previous Dot and though ""eh, not really a great device... shame..."" then these are the dots for you.And if you're looking to get into the Alexa universe, YES, this is now a perfectly good standalone Alexa device<U+2014>no ""bigger"" Echo needed. For all tasks except perhaps as a primary music delivery system, a Dot is now absolutely good enough and fit for purpose to be a single Alexa device in your kitchen, office, bedroom, or whatever. Buy with confidence.",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Worth every penny","I've had several Echo Dots for a while, but last year my son took my living room dot to his room, so I finally decided to replace it. WOW! The sound quality and overall heft of the 3rd gen is leaps and bounds above gen 2! I'm seriously trying to decide if I should replace all our gen 2s with 3s because it is markedly better. The volume is louder, the sound richer and deeper, and the time it took to connect was much faster.All that said, if you're on the fence about getting one, let me tell you what a lifesaver they have been to my family. I easily juggle large meal prep with my multiple timers and quick conversions from Alexa while jamming to my customized cooking playlist. We all use the shopping list function - even my youngest knows when he's used the last of whatever he needs to tell it to Alexa so I can replace it. But the best perk of all has been seeing my 19 year old brain injury survivor utilize it to remind himself of... everything. She is his alarm when he needs to get up for an appointment, she reminds him to shower and put on clean clothes, she reminds him of appointments and activities, she even plays his favorite music and tells him jokes. But seriously, she has helped him start adulting, and that has been priceless!",9
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Almost perfect and better than I could've hoped...","Overall, a really great product, both in terms of hardware and software. I did my research and found the Amazon platform to be better in almost every area compared to the Googles choices. And you can't beat the price. I bought one for every room with the smart plug bundle. The sandstone us a nice grayish white color, the sound is very clear and no tinny noise when turned to max volume. Alexa understands most every voice command and is very customizable. The only thing is that sometimes when I'm in the living room and make a request, the Echo dot in the half bath near the living room will trigger instead. I wish there was a fix for this but I have yet to find it other than always shutting the bathroom door completely. It's honestly an rather growing nuisance. Amazon, any suggestions?That being said, I would not hesitate to highly recommend these to anyone. They are relatively easy to setup and anyone with some very basic network connectivity knowledge can do it. I liked them so much I bought a Dot and an Input for my parents and one for my in-laws. Also, as a side note, the Input made my TV soundbar a true joy! Turning a dumb speaker into a smart one was worth every penny and ten some. We rarely used that speaker until now, we use it daily. Thanks Amazon!",10
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","UNABLE TO SETUP - USELESS","Doesn't work for me on Samsung Galaxy S8 phone using T-mobile...DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE THIS COMBO!!!!Went through the set-up multiple times. Each time I completed it, the App then directs you to enable the Free One Year subscription of FreeTime Unlimited. Each time I go through those steps and it asked to verify with a OTP (one time password) text and the text does not arrive. I prompted to re-send multiple times and nothing.When you kill the FreeTime setup the DOT setup is canceled.The DOT will not respond.I called amazon tech support.He asked me to confirm that the Alexa App has permission to send receive notifications. (I had already checked that but he made me re-check). Then he tells me I have to re-boot my phone. A convenient way to get rid of me. The second guy was useless. The third guy told me there was no reason to reboot. He tried to send me a text manually and it did not arrive. This tech told me there is a known issue with T-mobile blocking Amazon's texts. They recommended I call Tmobile.Well, I spent 30 minutes on the phone with T-mobile tech support. They turned off all the anti-spam filters that try and reduce all those Chinese spam calls and texts and guess what? ... it didn't work. IT STILL DOESN'T WORK.Roughly 1 out of 5 mobile phones in the US are T-mobile. You would think that Amazon would 1) set up their verification systems to be compatible, and 2) configure the set-up on these devices so that it is not 100% dependent upon a verification process tied to something completely separate.",10
"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","WiFi Support Limited up to ""N""!","I purchased 3 Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen to use as an intercom and for entertainment around my home and I noticed immediately the Echo Dot has severe Wi-Fi COMPATIBILITY issues that are not so beyond average consumers:1) Wi-Fi support is advertised as 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz connectivity however the dot will not see 'AC' networks that I have set up. The 2.4 Ghz network still inadequate even though signal strength reports FULL. Checking Wi-Fi signal strength from the access point shows that the Echo Dot 3rd Gen has a signal quality of above 80% and even comparing superior, similar, and inferior devices with much lower signal strength and a much higher SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) the Echo Dot is guaranteed to have issues. I am so astonished by the design of something that can't even stay connected as well as something with batteries!2) The Echo Dot 3rd Generation does not have a ""built-in"" battery for a""lightweight speaker"" and using the Alexa app for ""setting it up"" becomes a routine nuisance. It would be much better if voice prompts could be eliminated altogether and ""maybe if it just had lights""... must be the ULTRA COOL THERMODYNAMIC DESIGNIt can definitely keep your beer cold!",10
"October 15, 2018","the United States","5","Very valuable to my family.","This purchase was the start of something very special, lol. I have fallen in love with this technology and the ability to make my home a smart home. I have purchased two echo show 5¡¯s recently (one to replace my bedroom alarm clock and one as a gift) and more smart plugs. Alexa rarely disappoints.The echo dot is wonderful to have. It alerts me when my items are out for delivery and again when they are delivered (no more constant checking if the mail has been here, woohoo!), I can easily listen to the ¡°Flash briefing,¡± for local news and weather. This is a great feature since I cut cable and lost access to the local news channels. (My fire tv and two fire sticks help with that problem though as well!) You really can¡¯t go wrong with the echo dot as a starter Alexa/smart device. I will be purchasing more as gifts I am sure! My favorite feature is probably the ability to drop in and call/message/announce to other echo devices. It is very useful when communicating in a large, multi level house to my aging grandmother and disabled mother. They can¡¯t really navigate smart phones well, but the echo devices are pretty much idiot proof, lol.",10

Also a dust magnet.I¡¯m not going to be rough on a product I got for .99¡Ë. A promotion for signing up with Amazon Music Ul. I was ditching another service anyways.The speaker has a fuller and more immersive sound. Keep your expectations realistic. Music is more enjoyable and less tinny.Alexa falls flat. Not the service, but when she interacts. The voice sounds like she¡¯s underwater. Even worse if you have a slight echo. Picture the bathroom. Not a deal-breaker, but still annoying. I¡¯m more sensitive to tones with my blindness. Hopefully a correction for the next generation. Also, Google Mini doesn¡¯t suffer from this. Relatively similar in size.My REAL issue is the AC adapter. Who¡¯s brilliant idea was it to ditch the micro USB? Less intrusive over this monstrosity that plugs in. Not practical for areas like a bathroom. Certainly not dealing with a Johnny I¡¯ve design aesthetic. Yeah, I know it¡¯s a $50 product.

I ask the exact same question word for word and Google Mini answers me correctly. Google also will give me exact weather conditions and numbers like it is sunny and 92 degrees outside, tonight expect a low of 65 degrees. Alexa says the same thing pretty much but the information is incorrect. She also says, ""I'm not sure what went wrong"" I talk to my family members and ""she"" starts playing music or says something ridiculous. I didn't even say hey Alexa or Alexa what time is it?? If I did then it is doing its job, if i am speaking to my kids about something I feel like it's listening to my conversations and then acting out on some ""keywords"" but guess what???

"October 15, 2018","the United States","1","Disappointed and worried about the security issues","I bought these (several) because they were supposed to work with my Sonos to play Apple Music. I have invested heavily in Sonos, so I¡¯m stuck but I¡¯m increasingly frustrated by the app and difficulty of playing my music.The Echo will play Apple Music on its tiny little speaker but it STILL cannot play it on the connected Sonos. It keeps telling me that service is not supported.And, this part is the worst, when Alexa¡¯s internet brain is offline or slowed down, the error messages make you think you have screwed up. It¡¯s like, you have suddenly forgotten how Alexa works and haven¡¯t said things exactly right. Internet search for ¡°Is Alexa down¡± and you find out that it¡¯s not you, it¡¯s her.This happened right after I bought them I almost burned them in the fireplace.BTW, I bought Apple¡¯s HomePod when it was a hundred dollars on sale this Christmas, and at that price, it is totally worth it. It sounds great, set-up is far easier, Siri will set timers just fine, and control over my Hue lights etc is flawless. It synchronizes music with other HomePods and with the speakers you have plugged into your Apple TVs. (And Amazon has had some astounding privacy and security violations from Ring doorbell to Alexa laughing to recording hours of audio to send to unknown servers.) If you subscribe to AppleMusic the HomePod really the best choice.",10
"October 15, 2018","the United States","2","Great as stand-alone, poor for familes","Amazon's software engineers have clearly not considered family or multi-person households when designing the software for this device. I have spent close to 10 hours trying to fix what should have been a basic trouble-shooting matter: we have two kids on two kids echos. Each dot is registered to a different kid. Each kid has a Spotify account. It took forever to figure out how to have each Echo play different songs at the same time. Note: I wasn't trying to figure this out on my own, this was with the help of Amazon support both online and over the phone. 10 HOURS! And it still isn't at 100%--the Alexa app on my phone still says things that are not consistent with what is happening in each Echo Dot.Look, I understand this kind of thing is complicated to design. But, come on. Amazon is clearly pricing the Dots so that there can be multiple dots in a household. And there is usually more than one person per household. How could they not have considered ""musical multitasking"" in their testing?",10
"October 15, 2018","the United States","3","Works ok, sounds terrible...","This works just like any other Alexa type device and does an OK job of not knowing what you're talking about unless it's weather or music, but we're all pretty used to that. The three star rating is for the speaker. It sounds terrible. My daughter has a similar one and it too sounds horrible The speaker is muffled and has no high frequencies. I've asked Alexa to ""Turn up the treble"" and ""Turn down the Bass"" and she appears to do it. Doesn't help a bit.To get an idea of how the speaker may sound if you are thinking of buying one, remove a mono speaker from an old pickup truck (something from the early 60s), hook up some wires from a cheap stereo, wrap it up tightly in a small towel, insert the speaker and towel in a large Ziploc bag, and drop the entire thing into a 5 gallon bucket of water. Note that the truck speaker will sound slightly better but you'll get the idea. The strange thing is the Echo's speaker actually will sound decent if you hold it in your hand with the bottom facing out. This doesn't work if you place it upside down on a surface (I tried all sorts of different surfaces), only if you hold it in your hand. If you just want to hear Alexa's voice the built in speaker will suffice. But if you would like to listen to music on your Echo you should order an external speaker to go with it or prepare to be disappointed.",10
